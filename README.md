# code-quiz
This homework was to create a code quiz that will time the user, save their score and initials, save all of the highscores, and then print out a highscore page with all the saved scores. I was able to create the question choice buttons and have the current question displayed and then have it updated with the next quesrtion from the array. I created a time interval that timed the user and subtracted time if the user chose the wrong answer to a question. I was also able to save the score and input data to local storage. However, I could not figure out where in my code did I mess up and I was not able to print out the saved highscores on the highscores webpage.
